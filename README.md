Overview
Earth’s systems are deeply interconnected — from the atmosphere and water cycles to vegetation and wildfire dynamics. However, traditional visualization tools often fail to capture these complex interdependencies in a way that is accessible and interactive.

Our innovative web platform bridges this gap by using NASA Earth observation data with modern web technologies to create immersive, real-time visualizations. The platform enables users to explore planetary system interactions and understand environmental interconnectedness through engaging, interactive digital experiences.

Technology Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
Mapping Library: Leaflet.js
Data Sources: NASA APIs & Earth Observation datasets (Earthdata, FIRMS, GIBS, etc.)
