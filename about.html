      <h1>About Connected Earth</h1>
      <p>
        Connected Earth is an interactive platform designed to explore the 
        intricate relationships between our planet’s natural systems — from 
        rainfall and droughts to wildfires, pollution, and human health. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to make climate science engaging, educational, and 
        accessible. Using immersive visuals and storytelling, we show how 
        one change in the environment can ripple across ecosystems, societies, 
        and ultimately affect us all. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This project draws inspiration from NASA’s Earth-observing satellites, 
        which provide critical insights into these connections. By blending 
        technology and design, we aim to inspire awareness and encourage 
        collective action toward a sustainable future.
